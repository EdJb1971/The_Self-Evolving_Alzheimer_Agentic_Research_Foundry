#### How Learned Data Gets Fed Back Into Agent Contexts

**Current System (No Learning):**
```
Agent → Generates Output → Validation → Result Stored → END
```

**Self-Evolving System (With Learning):**
```
Agent → Generates Output → Validation → Success/Failure Analysis → 
Learned Patterns → Context Enrichment → Future Agent Contexts → 
Improved Agent Performance → Better Outputs → Cycle Continues
```

**Specific Feedback Mechanisms:**

1. **Agent Memory & Preferences**
   - Each agent maintains a "learned_behaviors.json" file
   - Tracks successful strategies: `{"strategy": "correlation_analysis", "success_rate": 0.85, "last_used": "2025-11-15"}`
   - Future decisions weighted by historical success rates

2. **Context Enrichment Pipeline**
   - Successful hypotheses added to knowledge base with metadata
   - Agent contexts include: "Previously successful approaches for biomarker discovery..."
   - LLM prompts enriched with: "Based on past successes, try focusing on inflammatory markers..."

3. **Orchestrator Learning Layer**

   - **Context enrichments sync insights back to knowledge base**
   - Semantic search enhanced with success metrics
   - RAG contexts include performance data: "This similar approach had 90% validation success rate"
   - **Closed feedback loop**: Learning → Knowledge Base → RAG → Agent Enrichment → New Learning

5. **Model Adaptation Triggers**
   - PINN constraints updated when new biological evidence validated
   - Uncertainty models recalibrated based on prediction accuracy
   - Statistical thresholds adjusted based on false positive/negative rates

New Performance Data → Continuous Learning Loop
```

#### Example Learning Cycle

```
Day 1: Biomarker Hunter Agent tries "genetic_correlation" approach
       → Validation shows 60% success rate
       → Learning: "genetic_correlation works moderately well for APOE variants"

Day 2: Agent context includes: "Genetic correlation successful for APOE, try similar for TREM2"
       → Agent tries refined approach
       → Validation shows 75% success rate  
       → Learning: "Refined genetic correlation very effective"

Day 30: Agent automatically starts with genetic correlation for new genetic biomarkers
        → Success rate now 80% due to accumulated learning
